// This is not your entire server.cfg, only the part that is relevant

// set g_gametype to 3 if the first map in the rotation is a dm, tow, or lib map
// set g_gametype to 4 if the first map in the rotation is an obj map

// this activates Freeze-Tag
set g_extgametype ft

// FT is currently supported on all Allied Assault and Spearhead stock maps
