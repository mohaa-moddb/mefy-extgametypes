// Sample server config for Mixed Gametypes (Allied Assault)
// This is not your entire server.cfg, only the part that is relevant
// to running mixed gametypes. You should copy and paste this to the end
// of your server.cfg.
//
// NOTE: This server config is only meant for Allied Assault-- if you are
// running Spearhead or Breakthrough, please use the mixed-types-sh.cfg
// instead!
//
// This will allow you to play mixed gametypes for Allied Assault,
// but has a few 'side-effects'. First, if you rotate to a new map where
// where "g_gametype" has changed, then after the first round of the next map,
// all of the players in the game will be thrown to spectator and will have
// to re-join a team to continue playing. Also, if you rotate to a new map
// that is round-based (ctf, ft, ftobj, vd, rbm, or obj) from a map that is
// non-round-based (ffa, tdm), then the round will start immediately instead
// of waiting for players. This will affect a freeze tag game by causing it
// to immediately end in a draw for the first round of the new map.
//
// In order to minimize these annoying side-effects, try to arrange your
// map rotation so that similar gametypes are adjacent to each other, and
// avoid making a freeze-tag map follow a free-for-all or team-match map.

// set g_gametype to the appropriate value for the first map in the rotation
// in this case it should be 3 for ctf on mohdm1
set g_gametype 3

// these set the gametype for each map in your rotation
set g_extgametype_mohdm1 ctf      // Capture-The-Flag for Southern France
set g_extgametype_mohdm2 ctf      // Capture-The-Flag on Destroyed Village
set g_extgametype_mohdm3 ft       // Freeze-Tag on Remagen
