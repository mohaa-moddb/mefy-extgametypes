// Sample server config for Freeze-Tag-TOW
// This is not your entire server.cfg, only the part that is relevant
// to running FTTOW. You should copy and paste this to the end
// of your server.cfg.

// NOTE: This gametype is only for Spearhead and Breakthrough!

// set g_gametype to 5 for tow maps
set g_gametype 5

// this activates Freeze-Tag-TOW
set g_extgametype fttow

// team respawn delay should be off since it interferes with Freeze-Tag
set sv_team_spawn_interval 0

// un-comment the next line if you hate the winning cinematics at the end of the round
// set g_cinematics_off 1

// the map rotation (all spearhead tow maps)
// FTTOW is currently supported on all Spearhead and Breakthrough stock tow maps
set sv_maplist "obj/mp_ardennes_tow obj/mp_berlin_tow obj/mp_druckkammern_tow obj/mp_flughafen_tow"

// load the first map
map obj/mp_ardennes_tow
